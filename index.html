            <header><h3>Meet Morah Becca Tullman <br> OEC Director of Education</h3> </header>
            <byline><h4>By Jillian Bross</h4></byline>
            <p>Morah Becca became Director of Education at CTJ-OEC in 2020. She lives in Manhattan Beach and loves to visit the beach with her pets.  I spoke with her about her life and her new position.</p> 
            <p>JB:  Morah Becca, what brought you to our community and what was it like moving in the middle of COVID-19?
            <br>BT:  Lots of my family and friends live here so I wanted to be closer to them. I started working for CTJ in August 2020 and moved here in November. It was nerve-racking; I was worried about getting sick, so it felt extra risky arriving here and looking at housing. It was harder to settle in because I couldn’t see my childhood friends and family. The CTJ board supported me, helped move me in, and made me feel welcome.</p> 
            <p>JB: You have a high position in this school. What are your favorite and least favorite parts about your job?
            <br>BT: I was the academic director at a synagogue in Atlanta which is the same job as I have now. I like to guest teach students and lead t’fillah. T’fillah was boring when I was a kid, so I like trying to make it engaging. My least favorite part is paperwork!  And, because of the pandemic I can’t see all the students and teachers in person.</p>
            <p>JB: What is your favorite Jewish holiday?
            <br>BT: Sukkot is my favorite. Another name for Sukkot is the “season for joy,” celebrating the harvest and things we have.  Also, being aware of how fragile that is, aware that others don’t have as much and being grateful for what we have.</p>
            <p>JB: Where are you from and where did you go to school?
            <br>BT:  I am originally from California and grew up in Fresno. I am the oldest of four with one biological brother and an adopted brother and sister.  I went to college in many places. I finished my degree at University of Phoenix and completed my master’s degree at American Jewish University.</p> 
            <p>JB: What do you love to do in your free time? And tell us about your pets.
            <br>BT: I am a huge bookworm and enjoy hiking, walking on the beach with my dog, and playing board games. I have so many favorite books, I can’t choose. To Kill a Mockingbird, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and A Wrinkle in Time are probably my favorites. My dog Navah is mostly German Shepherd and Cedric is an orange and white tabby cat.  They are both rescues.</p>
            <p>As we can see, Morah Becca is already an asset to CTJ-OEC community, and we are excited to have her at our school.</p>

            <byline><h4>By Reese Perelson</h4></byline>
            <p><Ava Eisenberg is a madriha with the OEC Times.  She has been at CTJ for six years and started in 4th grade. She shared her thoughts about being Jewish and her experience at CTJ.</p>
            <p>RP: Ava, what was your favorite project or thing you did in CTJ?
            <br>AE: My favorite thing I did was dance where I met my best friends who are still my best friends now.</p>
            <p>RP: What is your favorite thing about being Jewish? What is your favorite Jewish holiday and why?
            <br>AE: It’s a community and everyone's welcome. It’s just special because you get raised a different way than other people. I like Rosh Hashanah because it is the time that my family comes together. It's also a New Year and a new start.</p>
            <p>RP: Who was your most impactful teacher at OEC?
            <br>AE: Morah Adina because she is so nice, caring, and she always had a smile on her face.  She made being in Hebrew school very good.</p>
            <p>RP: What are your other interests?
            <br>AE: I love swimming and playing water polo. I also like going to the beach. </p>

            <header><h3>CTJ During Covid</h3> </header>
            <byline><h4>By Harriette Wardwell</h4></byline>
            <p>This pandemic has been very hard for many people, and we have been turning to Zoom for many of our social interactions. Likewise, CTJ services and OEC Religious School are done on Zoom, with the occasional holiday drive-by celebration. </p>
            <p>CTJ has been hosting weekly Friday night and Havdalah services.  With a new theme each week, these occasions bring smiles to people’s faces. Although you just click a link and you are there, these services require more work than that. I spoke with CTJ Executive Director Tamah Kushner about how services are run. “It takes a lot of energy,” she says, “I have to be ready to share my screen, unmute people and make sure they know the process.”  There is also preparation. “I email the people who are participating,” she explains, “give them the link, and make sure they know what to do.”  Every Friday there is an agenda for what the service will look like.  “People have different opinions about worshipping on Zoom. I like how we can see each other, and chat about the backgrounds in people’s rooms,” Tamah shares, “I don’t like that we can’t all talk and sing at once together, and that we are not together in the building.” </p>
            <p>OEC Religious School is also happening on Zoom. With teachers meeting their students for short, but interesting sessions, religious school is one of the week’s highlights.  At 9:00 a.m. on Sunday, kids join Zoom and either go to their class or hugg.  The classes are run by awesome teachers, and students can learn about their ancestry, and explore interests in a variety of subjects through huggim. “I really like the small groups,” says Hebrew teacher Morah Ellen, and being able to connect with students more 1-to-1.” </p>
            <p>Fifth grader Lexi Silver likes Religious School too saying, “I think it's about the same (as being in person); there is not a lot different.” Though Covid is hard, it can’t stop the great community of CTJ!</p>

            <header><h3>Einstein Joined Our Family</h3> </header>
            <byline><h4>By Dylan Brozost</h4></byline>
            <p>One day, my mom was working at her vet hospital when a volunteer came in and said that a dog was found in an alley in downtown L.A. He was probably in a car crash and had a broken pelvis.  My mom said that he wouldn’t need surgery, but he would need a lot of medicine.  It was unlikely that he would survive. But it was worth a try because my mom wouldn’t give up on him!  They named him Dexter.</p>  
            <p>By the time Dexter was fully recovered, my mom had fallen in love with him!  She convinced my dad to come to the hospital by telling him that there was a litter of black lab puppies to see. There was, but my mom’s real plan was getting him to see Dexter. </p>
            <p>My dad came to the hospital and, of course, went straight to see the black labs! But my mom dragged him over to Dexter. And when he saw how much my mom loved Dexter, they took him home and changed his name to Einstein.  And that’s how Einstein joined our family! </p>

            <header><h3>Hamentashen Recipe</h3> </header>
            <!-- <byline><h4></h4></byline> -->
            <p> Makes about three dozen
                
            <h5>INTRO</h5>
            <p>The reason we eat hamantaschens around Passover time is because they are shaped in a triangular shape which represents Haman's hat. Haman had an evil plan and supposedly when you take a bite out of the cookie it prevents it from happening. This treat originated in Israel. Personally, my favorite flavor of filling is strawberry! If you're looking for a yummy, fun, and easy treat for your passover I would highly recommend this recipe.</p>              
                
            <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
            <ul>   
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup oil </li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li> 
                <li>5 1/2 to 6 cups flour </li>
                <li>1-2 small jars filling (apricot, prune or cherry preserves, poppy seed filling, etc.)</li>
            </ul>     
            <h5>DIRECTIONS</h5>
            <ol>  
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.</li>
                <li>Mix together eggs, oil, sugar and vanilla.</li>
                <li>Add baking powder and flour.</li>
                <li>Knead until smooth.</li>
                <li>Roll out very thin (1/8 inch if you can) on a floured board.</li>
                <li>Cut out circles with a drinking glass.Put a dollop of filling in the center of each circle.</li>
                <li>Fold in three sides over the filling to make a triangle with filling showing in the center.</li>
                <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes on a greased cookie sheet.</li>
            </ol>  
                <p>Gabrielle, who taught the third- and fourth-graders at that school, recommended dipping your finger in water and using it to gently moisten the rim of the dough circles before you fold them—she claimed it helps them stick or keep their form or something. All I know is that our third- through sixth-graders managed to create a good lookin’ and better tasting’ batch in no time, so I’m sure you can handle it too.</p>
